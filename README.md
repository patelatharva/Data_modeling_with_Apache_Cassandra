# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
In this project, I have performed data modeling for NoSQL databases with Apache Cassandra and completed an ETL pipeline using Python. I modeled data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. I created an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

Take a look at the notebook that I created for this project on this page:
